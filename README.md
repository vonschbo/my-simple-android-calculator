# ANU xxxx second assignment, 2016

### Author: Bo (u5495054)

## about our project:
This assignment involves developing a calculator app. The basic features required are:

* A single text entry field where users may enter mathematical expressions such as (2 + 3*4/5*(10*4))

* Expressions should include integer and floating-point numbers, binary operators including *, /, +, and -, the unary operator -, and bracketing

* A button to evaluate the input expression and display the result in the same text field

* The expression parsing algorithm must use a recursive data structure such as a Tree

#### Extensions:

* Buttons (numbers, operators) to assist users in entering expressions.

* Expression history - Save history of expressions entered by the user and make it available for reference.

* Persistent expression history.

* Provide helpful feedback to users when expressions have syntax errors.

## How to use our calculator APP

 It is a very simple APP, once you open it, you can type the expression you want by using the keyboard, 
 
 you can view and modify any changes you want in the expression.
 
 At the end of the input bar, "/?" button indicates to check the simple syntax error appears in the expression user entered, a toaster will appear.
 
 Every time the user press "=", the result of the expression will be given, and also saved to the textview under the button.
 
 The user can clear the saved result by pressing the button "CLEAR".
