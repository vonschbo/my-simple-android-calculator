## about our project:
This assignment involves developing a calculator app. The basic features required are:

* A single text entry field where users may enter mathematical expressions such as (2 + 3*4/5*(10*4))

* Expressions should include integer and floating-point numbers, binary operators including *, /, +, and -, the unary operator -, and bracketing

* A button to evaluate the input expression and display the result in the same text field

* The expression parsing algorithm must use a recursive data structure such as a Tree

## How to use our calculator APP

 It is a very simple APP, once you open it, you can type the expression you want by using the keyboard, 
 
 you can view and modify any changes you want in the expression.
 
 Press the "=" button, you will see the result evaluated.
